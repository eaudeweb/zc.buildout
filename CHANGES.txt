Status
******
The buildout system is under active development. Some near term
priorities include:

- Fixing `bugs <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bugs>`_

- Making buildouts more 
  `repeatable
  <https://features.launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+spec/repeatable>`_

- Adding support for making distributions from buildouts

- Better error reporing

- Handling of egg extras

- More recipes

Change History
**************

Next Release
============

Feature Changes
---------------

- Renamed the runsetup command to setup. (The old name still works.)

- Added a recipe update method. Now install is only called when a part
  is installed for the first time, or after an uninstall. Otherwise, 
  update is called.  For backward compatibility, recipes that don't
  define update methiods are still supported.

- If a distribution defines namespace packages but fails to declare 
  setuptools as one of its dependencies, we now treat setuptools as an 
  implicit dependency.  We generate a warning if the distribution
  is a develop egg.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Egg links weren't removed when corresponding entries were removed
  from develop sections.

- Running a non-local buildout command (one not installed in the
  buildout) ket to a hang if there were new versions of zc.buildout or
  setuptools were available.  Now we issue a warning and don't
  upgrade.


1.0.0b9 (2006-10-02)
====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

Non-zip-safe eggs were not unzipped when they were installed.

1.0.0b8 (2006-10-01)
====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Installing source distributions failed when using alternate Python
  versions (depending on the versions of Python used.)

- Installing eggs wasn't handled as efficiently as possible due to a
  bug in egg URL parsing.

- Fixed a bug in runsetup that caused setup scripts that introspected
  __file__ to fail.

1.0.0b7
=======

Added a documented testing framework for use by recipes. Refactored
the buildout tests to use it.

Added a runsetup command run a setup script.  This is handy if, like
me, you don't install setuptools in your system Python.

1.0.0b6
=======

Fixed https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/60582
Use of extension options caused bootstrapping to fail if the eggs
directory didn't already exist.  We no longer use extensions for
bootstrapping.  There really isn't any reason to anyway.


1.0.0b5
=======

Refactored to do more work in buildout and less work in easy_install.
This makes things go a little faster, makes errors a little easier to
handle, and allows extensions (like the sftp extension) to influence
more of the process. This was done to fix a problem in using the sftp
support.

1.0.0b4
=======

- Added an **experimental** extensions mechanism, mainly to support
  adding sftp support to buildouts that need it.

- Fixed buildout self-updating on Windows.

1.0.0b3
=======

- Added a help option (-h, --help)

- Increased the default level of verbosity.

- Buildouts now automatically update themselves to new versions of
  zc.buildout and setuptools.

- Added Windows support.

- Added a recipe API for generating user errors.

- No-longer generate a py_zc.buildout script.

- Fixed some bugs in variable substitutions.  

  The characters "-", "." and " ", weren't allowed in section or
  option names.

  Substitutions with invalid names were ignored, which caused
  missleading failures downstream.

- Improved error handling.  No longer show tracebacks for user errors.

- Now require a recipe option (and therefore a section) for every part.

- Expanded the easy_install module API to:

  - Allow extra paths to be provided

  - Specify explicit entry points

  - Specify entry-point arguments

1.0.0b2
=======

Added support for specifying some build_ext options when installing eggs
from source distributions.

1.0.0b1
=======

- Changed the bootstrapping code to only install setuptools and
  zc.buildout. The bootstrap code no-longer runs the buildout itself.
  This was to fix a bug that caused parts to be recreated
  unnecessarily because the recipe signature in the initial buildout
  reflected temporary locations for setuptools and zc.buildout.

- Now create a minimal setup.py if it doesn't exist and issue a
  warning that it is being created.

- Fixed bug in saving installed configuration data.  %'s and extra
  spaces weren't quoted.

1.0.0a1
=======
