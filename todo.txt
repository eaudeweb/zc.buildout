- Windows support

- Load from urls

- Common recipes

  - configure-make-make-install

  - download, checkout

  - Should it be possible to provide multiple recipies?
    Or should recipies be combined through inheritence (or
    composition)?

  - Python

- Need to better understand the way upgrading works in setuptools.

- Offline mode

- Some way to freeze versions so we can have reproducable buildouts.

  Maybe simple approach:

  - Egg recipe outputs dependency info with debug logging

  - Egg recipe has option to specify dependencies.  When used, 
    don't automatically fetch newer data.

- Part dependencies

- custom uninstall

- Fix develop so thet ordinary eggs fetched as dependencies end up
  in eggs directory.

- spelling :)

- document recipe initialization order


Issues

- Want to be able to control whether eggs get unzipped when they are
  installed.  This requires looking at a distribution after it's 
  installed and unzipping it if it's zipped.
