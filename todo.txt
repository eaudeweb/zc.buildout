- Report error if repeated parts


- tests

  - distribution dependency links

  - offline mode (there is an indirect test in the testrunner tests)


- Load from urls

- control python for develop (probably a new recipe)

- proper handling of extras

- Common recipes

  - configure-make-make-install

  - download, checkout

  - Should it be possible to provide multiple recipies?
    Or should recipies be combined through inheritence (or
    composition)?

  - Python

- Some way to freeze versions so we can have reproducable buildouts.

  Maybe simple approach:

  - Egg recipe outputs dependency info with debug logging

  - Egg recipe has option to specify dependencies.  When used, 
    don't automatically fetch newer data.

- Option to search python path for distros

- Part dependencies

- custom uninstall

- Fix develop so thet ordinary eggs fetched as dependencies end up
  in eggs directory.

  "fixed" except that fix is ineffective due to setuptools bug. :(
  

- spelling :)

- document recipe initialization order


Download Cache
==============

 a) cache for distutils fetches (buildout cache)

    - the cache should be in the 'find-links' so that distutils picks them up
      enabling the cache feature
 
 b) cache for recipes that download things (file cache)

    - simple library (z3c.filecache) that doesn't depend on buildout and is
      not a part of buildout but a library with a simple API (e.g. get(url,
      directory)->local file or None; set(url, directory, already downloaded
      file) -> return path of new file (move given file to download
      directory))

    - recipes that want to use this mechanism would depend on z3c.filecache

 - files of a) and b) probably should be held in separate areas

 - check work that fred did

 - a persistent cache should be optional, temporary directories will be used
   if no cache is defined

 - implementations for a) and b) have to create a directory in the download
   cache directory to store their files. case a) will be called "zc.buildout",
   case be will be called like the package that provides the cache feature
   (e.g. z3c.filecache).

Issues
======


- Should we include setuptools and buildout eggs for buildout process
  in environment when searching for requirements?

- We don't want to look for new versions of setuptools all the time.
  For now, we always use a local dist if there is one.  Needs more
  thought.
