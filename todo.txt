Issues

- Want to be able to control whether eggs get unzipped when they ae
  installed. This isn't so hard if you do it from the beginning, but
  it's hard to change your mind.  easy_install won;t want to reinstall
  an egg that's already installed, unless it does, at which point it
  gets rather confused. :)
