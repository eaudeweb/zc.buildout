Developing buildout itself
**************************

When you're developing buildout itself, you need to know two things:

- Use a clean python *without* setuptools installed.  Otherwise many tests
  will find your already-installed setuptools, leading to test differences
  when setuptools' presence is explicitly tested.

- Don't bootstrap with ``python bootstrap/bootstrap.py`` but with ``python
  dev.py``.

+1 for testing:

- You should have specific python versions at specific locations or
  PYTHONx.x environment variables pointing to those
  See zc.buildout testing.py, def find_python(version)

  The way to start the tests for Python 2.5 for instance would be::

    $ env PYTHON2.5=/path/to/python2.5 bin/test
