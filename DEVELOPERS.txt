Developing buildout itself
**************************

When you're developing buildout itself, you need to know two things:

- Use a clean python *without* setuptools installed.  Otherwise many tests
  will find your already-installed setuptools, leading to test differences
  when setuptools' presence is explicitly tested.

- Don't bootstrap with ``python bootstrap/bootstrap.py`` but with ``python
  dev.py``.
