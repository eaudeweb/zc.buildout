Developing buildout itself
**************************

When you're developing buildout itself, you need to know two things:

- Use a clean python *without* setuptools installed.  Otherwise many tests
  will find your already-installed setuptools, leading to test differences
  when setuptools' presence is explicitly tested.

- Don't bootstrap with ``python bootstrap/bootstrap.py`` but with ``python
  dev.py``.

+1 for testing:

- You should have specific python executable versions at specific locations or
  PYTHONxy environment variables pointing to those
  See zc.buildout testing.py, def find_python(version)

  If you use python2.5 to test then the test runner will look for
  python2.6 in your path. If you use any other python version it will look for
  python2.5 in your path or it will look for the PYTHON25 environment variable.
  
  To start the tests with Python 2.7 for instance would be::

    $ env PYTHON25=/path/to/bin/python2.5 bin/test
