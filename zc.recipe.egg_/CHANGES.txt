To do
*****

- Some way to freeze the egg-versions used.  This includes some way to
  record which versions were selected dynamially and then a way to
  require that the recorded versions be used in a later run.

Updated to work with zc.buildout 1.0.0b3.

1.0.0a3
=======

- Extra path elements to be included in generated scripts can now be
  set via the extra-paths option.

- No longer implicitly generate py\_ scripts fo reach egg. There is
  now an interpreter option to generate a script that, when run
  without arguments, launches the Python interactive interpreter with
  the path set based on a parts eggs and extra paths.  If this script
  is run with the name of a Python script and arguments, then the
  given script is run with the path set.

- You can now specify explicit entry points.  This is useful for use
  with packages that don't declare their own entry points.

- Added Windows support.

- Now-longer implicitly generate "py\_" scripts for each egg.  You can
  now generate a script for launching a Python interpreter or for
  running scripts based on the eggs defined for an egg part.

- You can now specify custom entry points for packages that don't
  declare their entry points.

- You can now specify extra-paths to be included in generated scripts.
